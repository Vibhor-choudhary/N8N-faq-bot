## 🌟 Inspiration / Credit

> "Built during the #30daysofAI challenge, this project shows how non-developers can automate FAQ responses by blending n8n (no-code automation), Gemini (AI LLM), and Google Sheets as a backend—a simple, scalable, and cost-effective AI support tool."  
> — Inspired by Vibhor Choudhary's [LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vibhor-choudhary_buildinpublic-day9-30daysofai-activity-7348953339792891905-P0y5)

## 📝 Requirements

- [n8n](https://n8n.io/) (self-hosted or cloud)
- A Google Account (Google Sheets API enabled)
- [Gemini API access](https://ai.google.dev/)
- Webhook endpoint for chat/message input

---

## 📊 How It Works

1. **User Sends a Question** to a webhook or chat trigger.
2. **n8n Workflow** fetches relevant FAQ from Google Sheets.
3. **Gemini Node** generates a conversational answer if FAQ is missing or needs contextualization.
4. **Reply Sent** back to the user/channel.

- **Follow n8n security guidelines** for workflows that process user input.
